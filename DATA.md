The project utilizes data from [https://data.gov.in/],  and [https://m.rbi.org.in/scripts/AnnualPublications.aspx?head=Handbook+of+Statistics+on+Indian+States] providing a reliable foundation for the statistics analysis.
I collected information from data.gov.in, which was released in 2020. However, I have supplemented this data with additional information from 2022 to provide the latest updates.
